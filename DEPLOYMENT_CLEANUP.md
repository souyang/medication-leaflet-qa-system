## 🎯 **Simplified Deployment Options**

### **Local Development:**
```bash
just up-fullstack  # Full-stack locally
just up            # Backend only locally
```

### **Production Deployment:**
```bash
just deploy        # Full-stack to Railway (recommended)
just deploy-backend # Backend only to Railway
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **For Development:**
```bash
just up-fullstack  # Start local development
```

### **For Production:**
```bash
just deploy        # Deploy to Railway
```

### **For New Engineers:**
1. Read `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Run `just deploy` to deploy
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Test with `curl https://your-app.railway.app/health`
