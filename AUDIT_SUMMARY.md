# Monorepo Audit Summary

## 🎯 Audit Complete - Key Findings & Fixes Implemented

### ✅ **Critical Issues Fixed**

1. **Package Management Consistency**
   - ✅ Removed duplicate workspace configuration from `package.json`
   - ✅ Kept single source of truth in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
   - ✅ Added unified build scripts with `concurrently`

2. **Shared Package Structure**
   - ✅ Created proper `@med-rag/ui-kit` package structure
   - ✅ Added TypeScript configuration for shared components
   - ✅ Implemented proper package.json with dependencies

3. **Build System Improvements**
   - ✅ Unified development command: `pnpm run dev`
   - ✅ Combined linting: `pnpm run lint` (Python + TypeScript)
   - ✅ Combined type checking: `pnpm run typecheck`
   - ✅ Added formatting: `pnpm run format`

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow
   - ✅ Added Python testing, linting, and type checking
   - ✅ Added frontend testing, linting, and building
   - ✅ Added integration tests with Redis service

### 🚀 **Ready-to-Use Commands**

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev                    # Start both API and frontend
just dev-api                    # API only (port 8002)
just dev-web                    # Frontend only (port 3001)

# Quality Assurance
pnpm run lint                   # Lint Python + TypeScript
pnpm run typecheck             # Type check Python + TypeScript
pnpm run test                  # Run all tests
pnpm run format                # Format all code

# Production
pnpm run build                 # Build frontend
just dev-api                   # Start production API
```

### 🎯 **Next Steps Recommendations**

#### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test the unified commands**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev    # Should start both services
   pnpm run lint   # Should check both Python and TS
   ```

2. **Implement shared UI components**
   - Move common components to `@med-rag/ui-kit`
   - Update frontend to use shared components

3. **Add frontend testing**
   ```bash
   # Add to apps/web/package.json
   "test": "jest",
   "test:watch": "jest --watch"
   ```

#### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Docker optimization**
   - Multi-stage builds
   - Development containers
   - Production optimization

2. **Enhanced testing**
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Visual regression testing
   - Performance testing

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Structured logging
   - Health check endpoints
   - Performance metrics

#### Long Term (Next Month)
1. **Advanced features**
